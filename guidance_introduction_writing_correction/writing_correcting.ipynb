In our case, we don't need that. We define the variable name to be `answer`, set a temperature of `0` because we want to prevent hallucinations and set our `max_tokens` to 500. If you were to use this in a real application, you might want to ensure the limit is not exceeded by the user and the resulting output. For example by splitting the text into chunks, limiting the input or controlling the max_tokens based on the token length of the users text."
